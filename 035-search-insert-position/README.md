# Problem

Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Example 1:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 5
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: [1,3,5,6], 7
Output: 4

# Solutions

## First Solution

Well, just loop through it and find the element which value is equal or greater than the target.
